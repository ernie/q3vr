* Lots of VR comfort and QoL features including:
  * full haptic effects support
  * weapon selection wheel
  * zoom with reticle for railgun
  * comfort options like vignette, height adjustements, weapon lasers, etc.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please bear in mind that this port is currently in **beta** state, which
> means that there may be some bugs and compatibility issues that will be fixed
> over time.


## How to play

To download and set up the game:

* Go to [Releases](https://github.com/RippeR37/q3vr/releases) page and download
  the most recent release and install (or extract) to directory of your choosing
* If you own full version of the game, place `pak0.pk3` file from original game
  in the `baseq3/` subdirectory

then any time you want to play simply:

* Start your VR runtime (e.g. SteamVR)
* Run `q3vr.exe`

> [!TIP]
> It's highly recommended to go through configuration options in `Setup` menu -
> before jumping into the game - to set controls and settings to your liking.

## Controls

By default the game provides default bindings for common actions based on
your controlers.

### Controls in the menu

* `B` on left hand opens/closes menu or goes one level up (like `ESC`)
* `B` on right hand resets position of Virtual Screen
* `Trigger` on active hand - selects currently selected option (like `LMB`)
* `Trigger` on inactive hand - makes this hand active

### Controls as spectator

* Free cam
  * Movement forward/backward/left/right is based done with left thumbstick
  * The exact orientation is based on left controller's orientation
* First person spectator
  * `B` on right hand resets the position of Virtual Screen
  * `A` on left hand changes spectate mode (free cam/first person/...)
  * `Trigger` on left or right hand changes the person thay is spectated

### Controls in the game

See table below for default mapping. Some of these will be affected by changes
made in the in-game `Setup` configuration menus.

### Changing bindings/setting custom actions

If you wish to change bindings, you can try doing so from your
VR runtime's input configuration screen (e.g. Steam VR input bindings) or
manually set specific actions to given keys. To do so, you need to create
`autoexec.cfg` file in the `baseq3/` subdirectory and set custom bindings with:

```
set vr_button_map_<key> "<action>"
```

These are the default mappings:

| Key | Action | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `PRIMARYTRIGGER` | `"+attack"` | Fire weapon|
| `SECONDARYTRIGGER` | `"+moveup"` | Jump |
| `PRIMARYTHUMBSTICK` | `""` |  |
| `SECONDARYTHUMBSTICK` | `"+scores"` | Player list |
| `PRIMARYTRACKPAD` | `"+scores"` | Player list |
| `SECONDARYTRACKPAD` | `"togglemenu"` | Menu/back |
| `PRIMARYTHUMBREST` | `"+alt"` | Enable alternative bindings |
| `SECONDARYTHUMBREST` | `"+alt"` | Enable alternative bindings |
| `PRIMARYGRIP` | `"+weapon_select"` | Opens weapon selection wheel (if enabled) |
| `SECONDARYGRIP` | `"+weapon_stabilise"` | Triggers weapon stabilization (if enabled) |
| `RTHUMBLEFT` | `"turnleft"` | Snap/smooth turn left |
| `RTHUMBRIGHT` | `"turnright"` | Snap/smooth turn right |
| `RTHUMBFORWARD` | `""` |  |
| `RTHUMBBACK` | `""` |  |
| `Y` | `"+button3"` | Taunt |
| `X` | `"+button2"` | Use item |
| `B` | `"+movedown"` | Crouch |
| `A` | `"+moveup"` | Jump |

details.


## Troubleshooting

If you're having some problems consider:

* Verifying that all necessary PAK files are located in `baseq3/` subdirectory,
  i.e. `pak0.pk3`, ..., `pak8.pk3` and `pakQ3VR.pk3`
* Removing all user config files from your profile's directory
  * On Windows this will be `%appdata%\Quake3\` (usually
    `C:\Users\$user\AppData\Roaming\Quake3`)
  * NOTE: this will remove your local configuration along with all the mods and
    map files you downloaded. Consider making a backup
* Checking if the problem occurs only in Single Player campaign, Skirmish mode,
  Multiplayer or in all of these modes
* Checking [previous issue reports](https://github.com/RippeR37/q3vr/issues)
* Updating drivers for your GPU, etc.
* Checking if there isn't a newer verions of `Q3VR` available which may already
  have a fix for your problem
  * You can also check older versions to see if it worked before
* **[BETA]** During beta, the game will open a console in the background with
  logs - they may contain something that will hint what's the problem

If you're unable to find solution to your problem yourself, please reach out to
