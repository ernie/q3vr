# [Quake 3 VR](https://ripper37.github.io/q3vr)

**Quake 3 VR** (a.k.a. `q3vr`) is a PCVR port of Quake 3 Arena game based on:

* [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) - community maintained fork of
  idTech3 engine,
* [Quake3Quest](https://github.com/Team-Beef-Studios/ioq3quest) - port of
  `ioquake3` to Quest 2/3 mobile headsets by **Team Beef**.

It includes many bugfixes, improvements and QoL features built specifically
for VR.

### Main features

* Full Single-Player campaign
  * including full 6DoF support
* Multiplayer support
  * including crossplay with PC and Quest players
  * support for playing on servers with _simpler_ mods like OSP, unfreeze, CA,
    etc.
* Custom Virtual Screen for displaying 2D content
* Lots of VR comfort and QoL features including:
  * full haptic effects support
  * weapon selection wheel
  * zoom with reticle for railgun
  * comfort options like vignette, height adjustements, weapon lasers, etc.


## How to play

To download and set up the game:

* Go to [Releases](https://github.com/RippeR37/q3vr/releases) page and download
  the latest release and install (or extract, if selected portable version) to
	directory of your choosing,
* If you own full version of the game, place `pak0.pk3` file from original game
  in the `baseq3/` subdirectory.

then any time you want to play simply:

* Start your VR runtime (e.g. SteamVR)
* Run `q3vr.exe`

> [!TIP]
> It's highly recommended to go through configuration options in `Setup` menu -
> before jumping into the game - to set controls and settings to your liking.

> [!NOTE]
> The game has built-in update notifications. Whenever new version will be
> released, you will be notified about it on game startup.

## Controls

By default the game provides default bindings for common actions based on
your controlers.

### Controls in the menu

* `B` on left hand opens/closes menu or goes one level up (like `ESC`)
* `B` on right hand resets position of Virtual Screen
* `Trigger` on active hand - cursor click
* `Trigger` on inactive hand - makes this hand the active one

### Controls as spectator

* Free cam
  * Movement forward/backward/left/right is based done with left thumbstick
  * The exact orientation is based on left controller's orientation
* First person spectator
  * `B` on right hand resets the position of Virtual Screen
  * `A` on left hand changes spectate mode (free cam/first person/...)
  * `Trigger` on left or right hand changes the person thay is spectated

### Controls in the game

See table below for default mapping. Some of these will be affected by changes
made in the in-game `Setup` configuration menus.

### Changing bindings/setting custom actions

If you wish to change bindings, you can do so from your VR runtime's input
configuration screen (e.g. Steam VR input bindings) or manually set specific
game actions to given keys. To do so, you need to create `autoexec.cfg` file in
the `baseq3/` subdirectory and set custom bindings with:

```
set vr_button_map_<key> "<action>"
```

These are the default mappings:

| Key | Action | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `PRIMARYTRIGGER` | `"+attack"` | Fire weapon|
| `SECONDARYTRIGGER` | `"+moveup"` | Jump |
| `PRIMARYTHUMBSTICK` | `""` |  |
| `SECONDARYTHUMBSTICK` | `"+scores"` | Player list |
| `PRIMARYTRACKPAD` | `"+scores"` | Player list |
| `SECONDARYTRACKPAD` | `"togglemenu"` | Menu/back |
| `PRIMARYTHUMBREST` | `"+alt"` | Enable alternative bindings |
| `SECONDARYTHUMBREST` | `"+alt"` | Enable alternative bindings |
| `PRIMARYGRIP` | `"+weapon_select"` | Opens weapon selection wheel (if enabled) |
| `SECONDARYGRIP` | `"+weapon_stabilise"` | Triggers weapon stabilization (if enabled) |
| `RTHUMBLEFT` | `"turnleft"` | Snap/smooth turn left |
| `RTHUMBRIGHT` | `"turnright"` | Snap/smooth turn right |
| `RTHUMBFORWARD` | `""` |  |
| `RTHUMBBACK` | `""` |  |
| `Y` | `"togglemenu"` | Menu/back |
| `X` | `"+button2"` | Use item |
| `B` | `"+movedown"` | Crouch |

## Troubleshooting

If you're having some problems consider:

* Verifying that all necessary PAK files are located in `baseq3/` subdirectory,
  i.e. `pak0.pk3`, ..., `pak8.pk3` and `pakQ3VR.pk3`
* Removing all user config files from your profile's directory
  * On Windows this will be `%appdata%\Quake3\` (usually
    `C:\Users\$user\AppData\Roaming\Quake3`)
  * NOTE: this will remove your local configuration along with all the mods and
    map files you downloaded. Consider making a backup
* Checking if the problem occurs only in Single Player campaign, Skirmish mode,
  Multiplayer or in all of these modes
* Checking [previous issue reports](https://github.com/RippeR37/q3vr/issues)
* Updating drivers for your GPU, etc.
* Checking if there isn't a newer verions of `Q3VR` available which may already
  have a fix for your problem
  * You can also check older versions to see if it worked before

If you're unable to find solution to your problem yourself, please reach out to
the community (see section below) or
[create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/RippeR37/q3vr-private/issues/new/choose).
Please remember to provide as much details as you can which will help us
understand the problem and find a solution for it.
